# migrate.sh — applies the schema in server/db/migrations/ to the PulsHealth
# database and records what it applied in the schema_migrations table.
#
#   migrate.sh            apply every pending migration (the default)
#   migrate.sh baseline   mark an existing, hand-migrated database as current
#
# The Compose `migrate` service runs this before every app service starts
# (`docker compose up -d`), and operators run it by hand with
# `docker compose run --rm migrate [baseline]`. See server/README.md,
# "Schema migrations".
#
# Files in the migrations directory are applied in lexical order:
#
#   NNN_name.sql   one-shot. Applied once inside a single transaction
#                  (psql --single-transaction, ON_ERROR_STOP) together with the
#                  row that records it, so a failed file leaves nothing behind.
#                  An applied file is immutable: when its checksum no longer
#                  matches the recorded one this script refuses to continue.
#                  Two first-line markers change that:
#                    -- puls:rerun           re-applied whenever its checksum
#                                            changes (CREATE OR REPLACE files)
#                    -- puls:no-transaction  applied statement by statement,
#                                            for files with a statement that
#                                            cannot run in a transaction block
#                                            (refresh_continuous_aggregate)
#   NNN_name.sh    run on every invocation. These are idempotent and env-driven
#                  (roles and passwords, the calendar zone) and are never
#                  recorded.
#
# Connection (the Compose service sets these; defaults suit it):
#   PGHOST (db)  PGPORT (5432)  POSTGRES_USER (postgres)  POSTGRES_DB (postgres)
#   PGPASSWORD, or POSTGRES_PASSWORD as its fallback
#   MIGRATIONS_DIR  defaults to ./migrations next to this script
# The *.sh migrations additionally read GRAFANA_DB_PASSWORD, API_DB_PASSWORD,
# INGEST_DB_PASSWORD and PULS_TIME_ZONE from the environment.

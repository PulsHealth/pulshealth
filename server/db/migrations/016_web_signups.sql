-- Sign-up requests, and the few privileged steps the viewer's accounts mode
-- needs beyond reading one person's records (015_web_accounts.sql).
--
-- Anyone may ask for an account (/signup); nothing exists for them until an
-- administrator approves it on /admin. Approval creates the user, the
-- viewer then emails an invite, and only a signed-in person can connect
-- their own iPhone. So no data can arrive for anyone the operator has not
-- accepted: before approval there is no user, no account and no sync token.
--
-- Those steps write where web_app has no grant — `users`, `device_tokens`,
-- and (for a deletion) every table holding health data — so each is a
-- SECURITY DEFINER function owned by the migrating superuser, and web_app
-- may EXECUTE exactly these (099_read_roles.sh grants and asserts it).
--
-- The boundary that holds even against a compromised viewer: **these
-- functions act only on users an approved sign-up created**, recorded in
-- auth.self_service_users, which web_app can read but never write. The
-- operator's own household (users that arrived any other way: the seeded
-- default user, `make issue-device`, `make web-invite`) cannot be given a
-- token, disabled, deleted or purged through the viewer at all — only read,
-- as before. Each function also takes the caller's session (its SHA-256, as
-- auth.sessions stores it) and acts for that account; that scopes normal use
-- to the signed-in person, but it is not a barrier against SQL run as
-- web_app, which writes auth.sessions itself to sign people in.
--
-- Every definer function pins search_path to pg_catalog and names its
-- objects in full, so nothing a caller creates can stand in for them.
